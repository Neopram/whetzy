# Whetzy — Architecture Decision Log

## ADR-1 — Monolith, not microservices (2026-09-07)

**Decision:** FastAPI monolith with internal service boundaries (`content`, `engine`, `gamification`).

**Reason:** Single-person team, low traffic in early stage, microservices complexity not justified.

**Alternatives discarded:** Kubernetes + separate services (too much operational overhead).

---

## ADR-2 — Groq + qwen3.8-27b for AI tutor (2026-09-07)

**Decision:** Groq inference API with `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`.

**Reason:** Free tier, low latency (<500ms), no GPU cost. Quality sufficient for explanation use case.

**Alternatives discarded:** OpenAI (cost), llama-3.3-70b (not available on Groq free tier).

---

## ADR-3 — Alembic with auto-stamp in start.sh (2026-09-08)

**Decision:** `start.sh` runs `alembic stamp head && alembic upgrade head` at startup.

**Reason:** Pre-existing production DB had no `alembic_version` row. Stamp avoids "target database is not up to date" on first deploy.

**Alternatives discarded:** Recreate DB from scratch (loses production users).

---

## ADR-4 — DKT with torch optional + EWA fallback (2026-09-08)

**Decision:** PyTorch LSTM for DKT only instantiated when `torch` is importable; falls back to exponential weighted average.

**Reason:** Railway free tier may OOM on PyTorch imports. EWA gives reasonable predictions without a model.

**Alternatives discarded:** Torch required (risky OOM in production).

---

## ADR-5 — Ledger-based orchestration (2026-09-08)

**Decision:** Autonomous sessions driven by `docs/AUTONOMOUS_STATE.md` ledger. Each session reads the ledger, picks the lowest-priority TODO without blocking deps, executes, marks DONE with evidence, commits, repeats. Sessions self-schedule via `mcp__scheduled-tasks__create_scheduled_task`.

**Reason:** A monolithic prompt degrades attention. State must live outside context. Each session makes its own scheduling decision, so the chain breaks cleanly when the backlog is exhausted.

**Alternatives discarded:** Cron without ledger check (burns budget), single giant prompt.

---

## ADR-6 — Parallel workers over shared files (2026-09-08)

**Decision:** Parallel worker agents operate on disjoint file sets (defined in G1–G7 groups in the ledger). No git worktrees needed.

**Reason:** Worktrees add merge cost. Disjoint file sets guarantee no conflicts.

**Alternatives discarded:** Always using worktrees (merge overhead per task).

---

## ADR-7 — Recurring cron task for session continuity (2026-09-08)

**Decision:** Autonomous loop runs as a cron task (`23 */6 * * *`) instead of a one-shot. Pre-flight checks ledger; exits quickly if backlog is exhausted.

**Reason:** A one-shot chain dies permanently if a context-limit cut arrives before the next session is scheduled. Cron retries automatically.

**Alternatives discarded:** One-shot chain (fragile), no automation (requires manual session starts).

---

## ADR-8 — Raw token never stored; SHA-256 hash only (2026-09-08)

**Decision:** `PasswordResetToken` and `EmailVerificationToken` store only `sha256(raw_token)`. The raw token travels only in the email link.

**Reason:** If the token table is exfiltrated, tokens cannot be used without having received the email.

**Alternatives discarded:** Storing raw tokens (standard anti-pattern), bcrypt for tokens (overkill — token entropy already high, SHA-256 is sufficient for single-use secrets).
